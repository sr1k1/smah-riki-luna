                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Smah Riki, and I am a recent graduate with 
                        a major in Chemical/Biological Engineering! 
                        For the past year, I have been continuing research at 
                        my undergraduate ChemE lab while also developing my coding 
                        skills. My approach so far had been to work on smaller projects
                        to build quick and useful tools, but after joining Code the Dream,
                        I have been trying to pick up web development through a more 
                        formal means of education!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the downtime I have been enjoying since finishing college, I have
                        been trying to become more involved with my physical and mental health. 
                        I have been trying to become more consistent with running (if you're 
                        in the LA area, check out Koreatown Run Club!), and I have been cooking
                        more to hopefully become a regular cook for the betterment of my health!
                    </p>
